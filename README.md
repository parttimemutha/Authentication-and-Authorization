# Delete User Functionality

This project implements a basic "Delete User" functionality in a Node.js application using Express.js. The goal is to provide an example of how to delete a user by their username after authentication and authorization. The functionality also includes a simple frontend interface to interact with this feature.

## Features

- **Backend:**
  - **Express.js Server:** Handles routing, middleware, and controller logic.
  - **Authentication and Authorization:** Middleware for handling authentication and role-based access control (dummy implementation for simplicity).
  - **User Deletion Logic:** A controller function to delete a user by their username if they exist in the system.

- **Frontend:**
  - **Simple HTML Form:** Allows users to input a username to delete.
  - **JavaScript Fetch API:** Sends a POST request to the backend to trigger the deletion.

## File: `deleteUserFunctionality.js`

This single file contains both the backend and frontend logic for the user deletion feature. The backend is responsible for handling the HTTP request to delete the user, while the frontend provides a basic interface for user interaction.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have `express` installed.
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   node deleteUserFunctionality.js
   ```

3. **Access the Frontend:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4001/` to use the delete user feature.
