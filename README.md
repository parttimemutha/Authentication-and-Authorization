# Delete User Functionality

This project implements a basic "Delete User" functionality in a Node.js application using Express.js. The goal is to provide an example of how to delete a user by their username after authentication and authorization. The functionality also includes a simple frontend interface to interact with this feature.

## Features

- **Backend:**
  - **Express.js Server:** Handles routing, middleware, and controller logic.
  - **Authentication and Authorization:** Middleware for handling authentication and role-based access control (dummy implementation for simplicity).
  - **User Deletion Logic:** A controller function to delete a user by their username if they exist in the system.

- **Frontend:**
  - **Simple HTML Form:** Allows users to input a username to delete.
  - **JavaScript Fetch API:** Sends a POST request to the backend to trigger the deletion.

## File: `deleteUserFunctionality.js`

This single file contains both the backend and frontend logic for the user deletion feature. The backend is responsible for handling the HTTP request to delete the user, while the frontend provides a basic interface for user interaction.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have `express` installed.
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

2. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   node deleteUserFunctionality.js
   ```

3. **Access the Frontend:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4001/` to use the delete user feature.






### Step 2: Challenge Part 2

In the second challenge, we need to assess whether the requirement, "This delete user functionality can be done after authentication," is a good idea or a bad idea. Let's break this down:

#### Authentication vs. Authorization

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It answers the question, "Who are you?" This step typically involves verifying credentials like a username and password.

**Authorization**, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?" This is where role-based access control comes into play, determining whether a user has permissions to perform certain actions, such as deleting another user.

#### Is the Requirement a Good Idea?

Allowing user deletion functionality after authentication alone is not a good idea without considering proper authorization. While authentication verifies the identity of a user, it does not check if the user has the right to perform the delete action. If not carefully handled, this can lead to severe security risks, including unauthorized data modification or deletion.

A more secure approach would involve implementing an additional authorization check to ensure that only users with the appropriate role (e.g., an admin) can delete other users. This prevents malicious users from causing damage.

#### Why Authentication and Authorization are Different

1. **Authentication** is about identity verification. It’s the first step in securing access.
2. **Authorization** is about permission granting. It’s the second step that ensures the user has the correct rights to perform certain actions.

By keeping these two concepts separate, we can create a more secure and robust system.
